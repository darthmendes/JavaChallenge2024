This project is for Java Challenge_2024 from WIT.

Compiling the project is done by running "src\main\java\com\example\demo\JavaChallenge2024Application.java"

Using curl or your web browser, you should perform requests as is:
- GET /api/{ operation }?a={ X }&b={ Y }
where operation is one of the following: sum, subtraction, multiplication and division
X and Y are the number values you want to use in the calculations.
division is done like (a / b) 

I'm more familiar with Python's APIs and backend protocols but i think i managed to adapt and implement almost everything correctly in Java with Springboot and Kafka.
I tried to implement unit testing but since that differs from Python i wasn't able to learn everything in time of completion of this project (in the sense that you should have a folder called tests where specific scripting goes).
I did however, ran simple HTTP request based testing. Meaning if the operations were implement correctly and a minor error handling of the URL.
I'm also a bit unfamiliar with transforming Java projects in docker images  

I hope my work is according to the expected and I'm eagered to learn more and grow as a Backend Software Engineer.
